# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is forked from a start code repo for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

This is Mosse Sox's interpretation of the Tweet Project.
